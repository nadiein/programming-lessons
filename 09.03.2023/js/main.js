// Given two strings s1 and s2, we want to visualize how different the two strings are.
// We will only take into account the lowercase letters (a to z).
// First let us count the frequency of each lowercase letters in s1 and s2.


/* Solution one */
// time complexity of the algorithm is O(n)
export const mix = (s1, s2) => {
    
}
