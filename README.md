# Programming Lessons

## -----------------------------------------------

#### 3 times per week, we meet with students to resolve together
#### problems, exercises, that they are want to tear down.

#### Despitly, we've decided to use Python to resolve issues,
#### just for fun, I'll attach solved problem in JavaScript as well.

## -----------------------------------------------

## In each challenge folder located tests. For Javascript we use Jest and for Python we use Pytest.

### From the **js** or **py** folder =>
#### To run Javascript tests: **npm run test**
#### To run Python tests:     **pytest**
