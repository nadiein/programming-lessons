# Given a number of points on a plane, your task is to find two points
# with the smallest distance between them in linearithmic O(n log n) time.
# Example:
#     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
#   1  
#   2    . A
#   3                . D
#   4                   . F       
#   5             . C
#   6              
#   7                . E
#   8    . B
#   9                   . G
